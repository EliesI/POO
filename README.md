# Routes
 * 1 . /users
   
 GET /users => Retrieves a list of users.
 
 POST /users => Creates a new user.

 DELETE /users/:id => Deletes a user by ID.

 * 2 . /clock
  
 GET /clock => Retrieves the current time.

 * 3 . /working-time
   
 GET /working-time/:user_id => Retrieves working time for a specific user.

 POST /working-time => Creates a new working time entry.
